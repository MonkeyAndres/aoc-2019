# 🎄 Advent of Code 2019

Advent of code 2019 edition. This year I choose a functional approach to all the exercises.

Also I created my own functional library, very minimalist. Read the code [here](fp-utils.js).

## Usage
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run all days solutions
npm test
```

After day 8 I was unable to advance to more katas because of the complexity and the lack of time.
